## portfolio

This repository is dedicated to my **Portfolio Website**. Feel free to check it out, play around,
or *rip* whatever you want. 

My name is Justin Schwalm, I am working to become an independant full stack **JavaScript developer** and working in the **Crypto** world.
I believe that the decentralized finance networks being built now are the building blocks of our future financial systems and am excited to get involved.
